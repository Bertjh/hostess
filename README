Hostess
=======

A simple tool for adding local directories as virtual hosts in a local apache installation. It probably only works well on a Mac, but we're scratching our own itch here.

Usage
-----

    $ sudo hostess create mysite.local /Users/myuser/Sites/mysite

This will create a new virtual host in your Apache configuration, setup your Mac's DNS to respond to that domain name, and restart Apache to make the new virtual host live.
